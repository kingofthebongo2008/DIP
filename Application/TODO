* generate point cloud (by baricentric)
	- model has pointCloud struct - vao + point vector(size - numpoints, Point structs - triangle index, coords, barycentric coords)
* be able to show point cloud
* movable light
* deferred phong
* RSM creation
* deferred shadow mapping - complete direct illumination
* halton - initHalton()
* buffer split and gather with direct illumination
* discontinuity
* blur attributes
* blur
* ISM creation
* pull and push
* indirect deferred illumination
* load textures
* use materials for drawing from camera POV
